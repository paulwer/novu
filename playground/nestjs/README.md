# Novu NestJS Playground

This project is a simple example of how to use Novu Framework with NestJS.

## Quick start

This quickstart assumes you are running this application from the Novu monorepo and have already installed the dependencies.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the correct environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, run the application:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Finally, start Novu Studio and follow the CLI instructions to start creating your NestJS notification workflows:

```bash
npx novu@latest dev
```

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```
